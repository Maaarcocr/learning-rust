** Build these slides

It's generally recommended to use the [[https://git.irde.st/kookiespace/teaching-rust/-/jobs][CI artifacts]] for these slides,
but if you must build them yourself, you need to have Emacs (v26+) and
org-mode installed!

The following function will export the full course into an HTML slide
tree.
