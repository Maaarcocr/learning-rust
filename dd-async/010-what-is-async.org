* Async theory

  + Asynchronous programming aims to use system resources more efficiently
  + Execute code while waiting for external input
  + Developed under many different names
    + coroutines
    + co-operative multitasking
    + non-blocking I/O

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  A quick recap over what async development is.  You should all know
  this because this is an advanced course.

  We are not going to talk much about _why_ you would want to do async
  development, and instead focus on the how and internals of how this
  is implemented in Rust.
