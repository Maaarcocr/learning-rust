* 

  A synchronous webserver which handles two incoming connections

  A lot of that time might be spent waiting

  So instead, break out "work units" and handle them at the same time

* Concurrency vs Parallelism

* Async theory

  + Use system resources more effectively
  + Execute code while waiting for outside events
  + Developed under many different names
    + Coroutines
    + Cooperative multitasking
    + Non-blocking I/O
  
* Async state machines

  + Think of your program like a state machine
  + Sometimes states take a while to change
    + React to changes when they happen
    + Yield to runtime when there's nothing to do

* Futures

  + Represents a computation that _may_ return a result in the future
  + Needs to be polled (in some way or another) to make progress
  + A future might not run at all either
  + Yields when no progress can be made

* Executors

  + Acts as a scheduler for async code
  + Employes cooperative multitasking between futures
  + "Wake up" future when new work can be done

* How do we know when to wake?
